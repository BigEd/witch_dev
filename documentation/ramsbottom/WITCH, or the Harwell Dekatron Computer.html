		<h4>WITCH, or the Harwell Dekatron Computer</h4>

		<p>I've just knocked together this page quickly to put up some photos 
of the Harwell Dekatron Computer, known from 1957 onwards as WITCH. This
 computer was designed and built over the course of two years between 
1949 and 1951, at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in 
Oxfordshire, UK. For more details have a look at its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WITCH_%28computer%29">Wikipedia entry</a> or at the page dedicated to the computer at the <a href="http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/witch.htm">Computer Conservation Society</a>
 website. At the time of its retirement in 1974 it was the oldest 
computer in the world still in continuous use, and was proclaimed by 
Guiness World Records to be the “Most durable computer in the World”.</p>

		<p>Unlike the computers that we use every day, WITCH computed in base 10 using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">Dekatrons</a>.
 These Dekatrons formed the volatile memory (RAM) of the computer. The 
cathode in a Dekatron which was glowing allowed one simply to read the 
value (between 0 and 9) being stored in that Dekatron, making it an 
ideal early computer for teaching. These Dekatrons were arranged into 
lines of 9, the first representing the parity (plus or minus) of a 
stored number and the following eight its digits. The numbers that WITCH
 could store were therefore between -9.9999999 and 9.9999999, even in 
its heyday this was not the most powerful of machines; its attraction 
was that it was incredibly reliable. Whilst other computers in the 
fifties needed continuous nursing, WITCH was left for days at a time, 
running merrily whilst people went on Christmas holidays and the like.</p>
		
		<p>My grandfather, Cecil Ramsbottom was in charge of the running and 
maintenance of WITCH when it moved to the University of Wolverhampton 
(Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College at the time) in 1957.
 Here it was renamed to WITCH, Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching 
Computing from Harwell. Here's a photo of him (on the right) with the 
machine:</p>

		<p>Today, WITCH is being restored to its former glory, after several decades in storage, at <a href="http://www.tnmoc.org/">The National Museum of Computing</a>
 at Bletchley Park. Our family (my grandfather's four children and their
 children) visited a few days after Christmas 2009 to hand over the key 
to Tony Frazer, who's leading the project to restore the computer.</p>
		
		<p>There were formerly a number of keys in existence but all the 
others appear to have been misplaced and they “thought we were going to 
have to hotwire it”.</p>

		<p>Below are some of the photos that I took on the day. Clicking on a 
photo takes you to the full resolution (2808x1872) version. All photos

		<p>Fool that I am I didn't get a photo of the complete machine, but there are several such pictures on the <a href="http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/witch.htm">CCS website</a>.</p>

		<p>One memory store. Each row of nine Dekatrons stored one number, each bank stored ten numbers.</p>
		
		<a href="WITCH,%20or%20the%20Harwell%20Dekatron%20Computer_files/IMG_6190.jpg"><img src="WITCH,%20or%20the%20Harwell%20Dekatron%20Computer_files/IMG_6190small.jpg" alt="IMG 6185small" width="1024" height="682"></a>
		
		<p>Four memory stores. There were nine stores in total (as you can see in the photo with the key in it).</p>

		<p>The accumulators. These did the actual number crunching.</p>

		<p>Behind one of the memory stores (in my grandfather's writing), the 
names of the people who designed, built and used the computer at the 
Atomic Energy Research Establishment.</p>

		<p>The six tape readers were how programs and data were input to WITCH.</p>

		<p>You can't do computing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NowdrL6fvb4">unless you've got power</a>!</p>

		<p>The key fitted and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
		
		<h4>Cable Routing Photos</h4>
		
		<p>The cable routing at the back of the computer was incredible.</p>
